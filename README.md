An Analytics Vidhya Hackathon Submission. https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/wns-analytics-wizard-2019/

Competition Date: 24 Aug 2019 - 01 sept 2019

### Problem Statement
Zbay is an E-commerce website which sells a variety of products at its online platform. Zbay records user behaviour of its customers and stores it as a log. However, most of the times, users do not buy the products instantly and there is a time gap during which the customer might surf the internet and maybe visit competitor websites.

Now, to improve sales of products, Zbay has hired Adiza, an Adtech company which built a system such that ads are being shown for Zbay’s products on its partner websites.

If a user comes to Zbay’s website and searches for a product, and then visits these partner websites or apps, his/her previously viewed items or their similar items are shown on as an ad. If the user clicks this ad, he/she will be redirected to the Zbay’s website and might buy the product.

In this problem, the task is to predict click probability i.e. probability of user clicking the ad which is shown to them on the partner websites for the next 7 days on the basis of historical view log data, ad impression data and user data.

You are provided with the view log of users (2018/10/15 - 2018/12/11) and the product description collected from the Zbay website. We also provide the training data and test data containing details for ad impressions at the partner websites(Train + Test).

Train data contains the impression logs during 2018/11/15 – 2018/12/13 along with the label which specifies whether the ad is clicked or not. Your model will be evaluated on the test data which have impression logs during 2018/12/12 – 2018/12/18 without the labels.

### Dataset Description
You are provided with the following files:
train.zip: This contains 3 files and description of each is given below:

_train.csv_:

|Variable|Definition|
|----------|:-------------:|
|impression_id|AD impression id|
|impression_time|Time of the impression at partner website|
|user_id|user id|
|app_code|Application Code for a partner website where the ad was shown|
|os_version|Version of operating system|
|is_4G|1-Using 4G, 0-No 4G|
|is_click|(target) Whether user clicked the AD (1-click, 0-no click)|


_view_log.csv_:

|Variable|Definition|
|----------|:-------------:|
|server_time|Timestamp of the log|
|device_type|Device type of the user|
|session_id|Browser session id|
|user_id|user id|
|item_id|Item id|

_item_data.csv_:

|Variable | Definition |
|----------|:-------------:|
|item_id | Item id|
|item_price |Price of the item|
|category_1	| Category depth 1|
|category_2	| Category depth 2|
|category_3	| Category depth 3|
|product_type | anonymized item type  |

_test.csv_: test file contains the impressions for which the participants need to predict the click rate

_sample_submission.csv_: This file contains the format in which you have to submit your predictions.

### Evaluation Metric
Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.

### Public and Private Split
Test data is further randomly divided into Public and Private data.

Public leaderboard is based on first 3 days of data from the test dataset (2018/12/12 – 2018/12/14), while private leaderboard will be evaluated on remaining 4 days of data of the test dataset (2018/12/15 – 2018/12/18).

* Your initial responses will be checked and scored on the Public data.
* The final rankings would be based on your private score which will be published once the competition is over.
